# TinyPBR
The goal of the project is ending up with a (tiny) renderer that is able to present a chosen model with a PBR pipeline. The user can then manipulate all sorts of settings at runtime to see how it affects shading on the model. 
This project started out as a research project for myself to learn about Physically Based Rendering.

### API/Libraries/Tools used for the project:
- GLFW
- GLAD
- ImGui
- Assimp
